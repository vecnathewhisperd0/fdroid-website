The F-Droid website is now also available in the Basque language, thanks to the effort of several volunteer contributors through the years.

F-Droid is always getting better and changing, pages get updated, hence people interested in giving a helping hand to complete them or to improve existing translations are encouraged to contribute through the Weblate F-Droid portal (https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/-/eu/).
