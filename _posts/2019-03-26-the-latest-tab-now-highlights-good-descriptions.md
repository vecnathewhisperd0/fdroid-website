The \"Latest\" tab in the F-Droid Android client is a place
showcasing apps that put their features on display.
With the upcoming 1.6 release, the \"Latest\" Tab will be reserved for apps
meeting certain criteria. The goal is to know before you try, so users can
explore apps beforehand, by looking at their listings in F-Droid.
Installing apps should never be in vain, and is always a consern for security.
Info served upfront also makes it an even playing field, giving new users
a good idea of what they are about to install.

From release 1.6 onwards, only apps with *all* of the following
in their app metadata will be shown as \"Latest\":

* Name
* Summary
* Description
* License
* A \"What's New\ entry for at least one release
* at least one graphic (screenshot or a feature graphic)
* at least one of the above translated

This effort encourages app developers to put the extra effort into explaining,
with good help from the F-Droid community offering translations.
All apps will still be listed in the \"Search\" and \"Categories\" tabs.

Find out how to add the fields to your app by reading
