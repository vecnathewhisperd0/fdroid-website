The F-Droid website is now also available in the Catalan language, thanks to the efforts of
the serveral volunteer contributors through the years. And F-Droid is always getting better and changing, so always they come new strings. So People interested in giving a helping hand to complete them or to improve
existing translations are encouraged to contribute through the Weblate F-Droid
portal (<https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/f-droid/-/ca/>).
