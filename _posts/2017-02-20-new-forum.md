We are excited to announce the release of the new official F-Droid forum:
[forum.f-droid.org](https://forum.f-droid.org).

We have been working hard to [revise the website](https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/milestones/launch?title=Launch)
in order to make it easier to modernize, accept contributions, and internationalise.
The main part of this is switching the underlying technology from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
However, this caused us to think about the forum as it was powered by a WordPress plugin.
Quickly [we decided to drop the old forum](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues/6) in favor of an indepentently hosted one
and chose some modern software called [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org).

The old forum had a lot of disadvantages:
Firstly, you cannot reply by mail.
Secondly, the F-Droid volunteers had to waste time deleting massive amounts of spam (the old forum had 25% spam).
Finally, the overall user experience was bad,
and not only because of increasing number of bugs found in the forum software.

With Discourse, we hope to breath life back into the F-Droid community.
While app submissions recently [moved to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp),
and bug reports/feature requests still live in GitLab,
the new forum is the new centre for all discussions related to F-Droid.
All users of F-Droid,
whether discussing the client or the server tools,
can help each other there.

Because of temporary limitations of all F-Droid volunteers it was not possible to move the old forum data to the new one
which means that you have to re-register yourself.
Independent from this all old topics remain at the current URLs for now.

One interesting new feature is [local communities](https://forum.f-droid.org/c/other-languages).
In these communities you can discuss in your mother tongue about all topics related to F-Droid and free software on Android.
At the moment there is already a [German group](https://forum.f-droid.org/c/other-languages/german).

If you want to create your own local community,
please open a topic in the ["Other languages" category](https://forum.f-droid.org/c/other-languages) and
we will discuss everything else there.

Finally, there is one last insight into the current development of F-Droid:
we plan to use Discourse for [comments on the website](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues/36)
which gets us closer to [comments on single applications](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/issues/646).

Make sure you keep an eye on the new developments happening to F-Droid in 2017.
We for our part are curious if you like the new forum.
