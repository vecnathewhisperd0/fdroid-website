"Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work.  "
"The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common "
"for a single country map file to be well over 100MB.  Also, in order to get "
"users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge "
"amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first "

"Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/"
"google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of "
"delivering large amounts of data.  This arragement also saves lots of "
"bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  "
"For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be "
"shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it "
"does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."

"为了提供一种灵活的传输大数据方式，谷歌创建了 \"[APK 扩展](https://developer.android.com/google/play"
"/expansion-files.html)\" 文件，即：OBB。APK 和 OBB "
"文件可分开上传，因此这种方式还可以显著节省带宽。比如，游戏资源数据无需经常更改，所以可作为 OBB 提供。当该游戏应用自身（即 APK 文件）更新时，"
"更新数据无需包括 OBB 文件中的游戏数据。"

"OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME.  F-Droid supports "
"OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the "
"APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use.  F-"
"Droid also provides an `Intent` method for apps to fetch the OBB download "
"URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update.  That "
"is similar to how it works in Google Play."
msgstr ""
"许多应用如游戏和 MAPS.ME 使用 OBB 文件。F-Droid  对 OBB 的支持在于，可先在 APK 之前安装 OBB，这样安装 APK "
"之后即可使用，因为 OBB 已安装就位。同时， F-Droid 为应用提供 `Intent` 方式来获取 OBB 下载网址，以便通过应用自身来处理 "
"OBB 下载/上传。这种方式类似 Google Play。"

"In order to use the OBB support, users need at least F-Droid v0.102, and the "

"One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not "
"guaranteed to be installed by the app store.  That means the app could "
"start, and the expected OBB files will not be there.  In that case, the app "
"must download and install the OBB file itself.  Google Play recommends using "

"在应用中使用 OBB 文件的一个具体实例：应用商店不一定提供 OBB 文件的安装。这表示，打开应用时无法找到 OBB 文件。在这种情况下，"
