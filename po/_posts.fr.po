msgid "Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work.  The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common for a single country map file to be well over 100MB.  Also, in order to get users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first time."
msgstr "De nombreuses applications de jeux, de cartographie et autre, nécessitent de grandes quantités de données pour fonctionner. Le fichier APK d’une application Android est limité à 100 Mo, mais il est fréquent que le fichier de la carte d'un seul pays dépasse 100 Mo. En outre, afin de permettre aux utilisateurs de les lancer le plus rapidement possible, ils ne devraient pas attendre de télécharger d’énormes quantités de données pour pouvoir simplement lancer l’application pour la première fois."

msgid "Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of delivering large amounts of data.  This arrangement also saves lots of bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."
msgstr "Google a créé le format de fichier OBB (ou [APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)) afin de distribuer de gros volumes de données de manière flexible. Cette solution permet d’économiser la bande passante puisque le fichier APK et le fichier OBB peuvent être mis à jour séparément. Par exemple, les données d’un jeu ne changent pas souvent, et peuvent donc être livrées sous forme de fichier OBB. Ainsi, lorsque l’application elle-même est mise à jour (c’est-à-dire le fichier APK), elle n’a pas besoin d’inclure les données du jeu qui sont dans le fichier OBB."

msgid "OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME.  F-Droid supports OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use.  F-Droid also provides an `Intent` method for apps to fetch the OBB download URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update.  That is similar to how it works in Google Play."
msgstr "Les fichiers OBB sont utilisés par de nombreuses applications comme les jeux et MAPS.ME. F-Droid prend en charge l'OBB en téléchargeant et en installant l'OBB avant l'APK, de sorte qu'après l'installation de l'APK, les fichiers OBB sont déjà en place et prêts à l'emploi. F-Droid fournit également une méthode « Intent » pour que les applications récupèrent les URL de téléchargement OBB au cas où l'application elle-même devait gérer le téléchargement / mise à jour OBB. Cela ressemble à la façon dont cela fonctionne dans Google Play."

#. type: Plain text
#: build/_posts/md/2017-02-20-f-droid-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb.md
msgid "In order to use the OBB support, users need at least F-Droid v0.102, and the repo must use _fdroidserver_ v0.7.0 or newer.  Adding OBB files to a repo is very easy: just copy them to the same folder where the APKs go, i.e. _/path/to/fdroid/repo/_."
msgstr "Afin de prendre en charge le format OBB, F-Droid doit être au moins en version v0.102, et le dépôt logiciel doit utiliser _fdroidserver_ v0.7.0 ou supérieure. Il est très simple d'ajouter des fichiers OBB à un dépôt logiciel : copiez-les dans le même dossier que celui des fichiers APK, par exemple _/chemin/vers/depot/fdroid/_."

msgid "One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not guaranteed to be installed by the app store.  That means the app could start, and the expected OBB files will not be there.  In that case, the app must download and install the OBB file itself.  Google Play recommends using their proprietary [Application Licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html)  service for this, F-Droid provides a simple method that is all free software."
msgstr "L'un des détails sur l'utilisation des fichiers OBB dans les applications est que ces fichiers ne sont pas forcément installés par l'app store.  Cela signifie que l'application pourrait démarrer, et les fichiers OBB attendus ne soient pas là.  Dans ce cas, l'application doit télécharger et installer le fichier elle-même.  Google Play recommande d'utiliser pour cela leur service propriétaire [App licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html), F-Droid fournit une méthode simple et complètement libre."

The main part of this is switching the underlying technology from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  However, this caused us to think about the forum as it was powered by a WordPress plugin.  Quickly [we decided to drop the old forum](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues/6) in favor of an indepentently hosted one and chose some modern software called [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)."

Cependant, cela nous a amené à penser au forum car il était alimenté par un plugin WordPress.

These however require an internet connection to be downloaded from F-Droid's official server. Thankfully, F-Droid allows you to add other repositories to it. These work similar to the package repositories that you might know from GNU/Linux distributions. Everybody can create their own repository, even in an offline network. As long as people are connected to the same WiFi, they can use your repository to install and update your apps."

Having a worse store location than their competitors, it really helps them to drive people to their shop and to build up their reputation within the local community.

We at [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) used FCM for our old Android app. Unfortunately, FCM includes Google's tracking code for analytics purposes, which we didn’t want to use. And, even more important: For being able to use FCM, you have to send all your notification data to Google. You also have to use their proprietary libraries. Because of the privacy and security concerns that naturally go along with this, we did not send any info in the notification messages with the old app (which, understandably, led to complaints by our users). Therefore, the push notification in the old app only mentioned that you received a new message without any reference to the email itself or to the mailbox the message has been placed in."

msgid "  Enter **[PilferShush Jammer](https://f-droid.org/app/cityfreqs.com.pilfershushjammer)**, both a passive and an active microphone jammer. Its primary mode of operation is to hold an exclusive lock on the microphone, blocking other apps from even opening it. If that doesn't work, or if you suspect system apps are in play, it also has an active jamming mode, emitting its own tones from the phone's speaker, which hopefully interfere with these tracking sounds. Obviously this is less reliable, and of course, it's even better to not install hostile closed-source apps in the first place.\n"
