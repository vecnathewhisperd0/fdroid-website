If your app is GPLv3 and no source code is published by the plagiarists; their versions obviously include proprietary ad libraries, or any sign of your authorship was simply removed, those copies are breaking the law and you should [demand Google](https://www.google.com/android_dmca.html) to remove them from their app store. You may threaten them with DMCA or other local laws if you wish. If all else fails, before going proprietary, balance the loss and confusion to the users and maintainers of the free app against the feeling of justice that you'll get by seeing those illegal clones lose the few cents in ad revenue that they would have got.

Repository tags are the natural way of labelling new versions (look for them under \"releases\" on an example in [github.com](https://github.com/dschuermann/document-viewer/releases) or under the \"tags\" directory in the case of SVN repos). If you can't find tags it would be a helpful to make an issue about it on the issue tracker.

When paired with an auditing system, it is easy to catch malware inserted in the build process, rather than the source code, like XCodeGhost. Reproducible builds also makes it possible to have all builds of a release binary have the exact same hash. Then any app repository can build apps only from source code, and have a source of verification data from any other app repository building the same app. Building software from source has become cheap enough that many companies like gitlab.com and Travis CI are offering free, automated build services in the cloud. Since the whole F-Droid toolset is free software and designed to be easy to setup, the barriers to setting up automatic auditing are quite low.
