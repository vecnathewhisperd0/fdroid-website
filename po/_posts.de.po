"Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/"
"google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of "
"delivering large amounts of data.  This arrangement also saves lots of "
"bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  "
"For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be "
"shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it "
"does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."
msgstr ""
"Google schuf OBB, auch bekannt als Erweiterungsdateien (s. “[APK Expansion] "
"https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html“), um ein "
"flexibles Mittel zur Auslieferung großer Datenmengen bereitzustellen. Diese "
"Regelung führt zu einer deutlichen Einsparung des Datenverkehrs, da die APK-"
"Datei und die OBB-Datei getrennt voneinander aktualisiert werden können. Zum "
"Beispiel muss ein Spielaufbau nicht häufig geändert werden, somit kann er "
"als OBB ausgeliefert werden. Wenn dann die App selbst (d. h. die APK) "
"aktualisiert wird, ist es nicht nötig den gesamten Aufbau, der sich in der "
"OBB-Datei befindet, darin einzuschließen."
