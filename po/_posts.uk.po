"Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work.  "
"The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common "
"for a single country map file to be well over 100MB.  Also, in order to get "
"users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge "
"amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first "

"Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/"
"google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of "
"delivering large amounts of data.  This arragement also saves lots of "
"bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  "
"For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be "
"shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it "
"does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."

"OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME.  F-Droid supports "
"OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the "
"APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use.  F-"
"Droid also provides an `Intent` method for apps to fetch the OBB download "
"URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update.  That "

"One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not "
"guaranteed to be installed by the app store.  That means the app could "
"start, and the expected OBB files will not be there.  In that case, the app "
"must download and install the OBB file itself.  Google Play recommends using "
