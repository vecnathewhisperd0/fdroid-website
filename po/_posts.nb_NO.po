msgid "Many games, mapping, and other apps require a large amount of data to work.  The APK file of an Android app is limited to 100MB in size, yet it is common for a single country map file to be well over 100MB.  Also, in order to get users running as quickly as possible, they should not have to wait for huge amounts of data to download in order to just start the app for the first time."
msgstr "Mange spill, tastatursnarveier, og andre programmer trenger store mengder data for å virke.  APK-filen tilhørende et Android-program begrenser seg til 100MB størrelse, likevel er det vanlig for et vanlig landskart å overskride 100MB. For å få brukere i gang så fort som mulig, bør de ikke måtte vente på store mengder data å laste ned for å kunne starte programmet for første gang."

msgid "Google created OBB aka \"[APK Expansion](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)\" files to provide a flexible means of delivering large amounts of data.  This arrangement also saves lots of bandwidth since the APK file and the OBB file can be updated separately.  For example, a game's assets do not need to change often, so they can be shipped as an OBB. Then when the app itself is updated (i.e. the APK), it does not need to include all those assets that are in the OBB file."
msgstr "Google opprettet OBB-filer aka \"[APK-utvidelse](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html)\" for å tilby en fleksibel løsning for levering av store mengder data. Dette arrangementet sparer store mengder båndbredde siden APK-fila og OBB-fila kan oppdateres hver for seg.  For eksempel, trenger ikke ting som tilhører spill å endres særlig ofte, så de kan leveres som en OBB. Når selve programmet oppdateres (altså selve APK-en), trenger ikke de filene å inkluderes der."

#. type: Plain text
#: build/_posts/md/2017-02-20-f-droid-supports-apk-expansion-files-aka-obb.md
msgid "OBB files are used by lots of apps like games and MAPS.ME.  F-Droid supports OBB by downloading and installing the OBB before the APK, so that once the APK is installed, the OBB files are already in place and ready to use.  F-Droid also provides an `Intent` method for apps to fetch the OBB download URLs in case the app itself needs to handle the OBB download/update.  That is similar to how it works in Google Play."
msgstr "OBB-filer brukes av en mengde programmer som spill og MAPS.ME.  F-Droid støtter OBB ved å laste ned og installere OBB-en før APK-en, slik at når APK-en først er installert, er OBB-filene allerede på plass klare til bruk.  F-Droid tilbyr også en \"hensikt\"smetode for at programmer skal kunne hente OBB-nedlastningers nettadresser i fall selve programmer trenger å hanskes med OBB-nedlasting/oppdatering.  Dette ligner hvordan det virker i Google Play."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "In order to use the OBB support, users need at least F-Droid v0.102, and the repo must use _fdroidserver_ v0.7.0 or newer.  Adding OBB files to a repo is very easy: just copy them to the same folder where the APKs go, i.e. _/path/to/fdroid/repo/_."
msgstr "For å kunne bruke OBB-støtte, trenger brukere minst F-Droid v0.102, og pakkebrønnen må bruke _fdroidserver_ v0.7.0 eller nyere.  Å legge til OBB-filer til en pakkebrønn er veldig lett: Bare kopier dem til samme mappen som APK-filene er i, altså _/sti/til/fdroid/pakkebrønn/_."

msgid "One of the details about using OBB files in apps is that OBB files are not guaranteed to be installed by the app store.  That means the app could start, and the expected OBB files will not be there.  In that case, the app must download and install the OBB file itself.  Google Play recommends using their proprietary [Application Licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html)  service for this, F-Droid provides a simple method that is all free software."
msgstr "En av detaljene vedrørende bruk av OBB-filer i programmer er at OBB-filer ikke er garantert å bli installert av programbutikken.  Det betyr at programmet kan starte, uten at den forventede OBB-fila er der.  I sådant fall, vil programmet laste ned og installere selve OBB-fila på egenhånd.  Google Play anbefaler deres proprietære  [Programlisensieringstjeneste](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html) for dette, F-Droid derimot tilbyr en enkel metode som er fri programvare tvers igjennom."

msgid "We have been working hard to [revise the website](https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/milestones/launch?title=Launch)  in order to make it easier to modernize, accept contributions, and internationalise.  The main part of this is switching the underlying technology from WordPress to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  However, this caused us to think about the forum as it was powered by a WordPress plugin.  Quickly [we decided to drop the old forum](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues/6) in favor of an indepentently hosted one and chose some modern software called [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)."
msgstr "Vi har jobbet hardt for å [fornye nettsiden](https://gitlab.com/groups/fdroid/milestones/launch?title=Launch) for å gjøre den enklere å modernisere, godta bidrag, og internasjonalisere.  Hoveddelen av dette arbeidet er å bytte den bakenforliggende teknologien fra WordPress til [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  Dette fikk oss på tanken om å gjøre noe med forumet, siden det ble drevet av et WordPress-programtillegg.  Raskt [besluttet vi å droppe det gamle forumet](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/issues/6) til fordel for et vi selv er vertskap for, og valgte i så måte den moderne programvaren kalt [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org)."

Videre måtte F-Droid-frivillige bruke mye tid på å slette store mengder spam (der gamle forumet hadde 25% spam).

But it had strange dates like `2042-14-03 00:62:15` in the ZIP entries, probably because of the tricks needed to assemble this DEX+ZIP file.  This triggered a crash in `fdroid update`, when parsing the date of _AndroidManifest.xml_.  Python complains that there is no 14th month.  This crash prevents the APK from being added to the repo. We have also added an [explicit block](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/merge_requests/409)  for APKs trying to exploit Janus."
