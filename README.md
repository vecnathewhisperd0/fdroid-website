Hey, my name is Radu!!!!!


# Website of F-Droid.org

This is the repository for the website at [F-Droid.org](https://f-droid.org).
It is based on Jekyll and you can find the development version
[here](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/fdroid-website/).

## Building

You need to have Jekyll 3.2+ installed what is easily done with Gem which depends on Ruby 2.0+.
Because of the F-Droid plugin you need to have zlib installed.

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
```

To build the website, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

If you want to build the website and
serve it with a local server at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000),
use:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Local development

* Clone [F-Droid's Jekyll plugin](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/jekyll-fdroid)
* Configure bundle to use it: `bundle config --local local.jekyll-fdroid ../jekyll-fdroid`
* Follow the steps above

If you want to use the official Git repository again,
run `bundle config --delete local.jekyll-fdroid`.

If you want to have another values for `site.url` and `site.baseurl` (default: `localhost:4000` and `fdroid-website`) you can add the from git ignored config file `userconfig.yml` and run all jekyll commands with this additional parameter:

```
--config _config.yml,userconfig.yml
```
